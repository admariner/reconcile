Find Company Officers
=====================

Use OpenCorporates to look up a list of companies and find their directors.

Takes a CSV named `companies.csv` with a column named 'companyNumber', and produces another CSV named `find-company-officers.csv`. Uses a configuration file `config.json` -- an example of what fields are required is in `config.example.json`.

Requires a recent version of [Node JS] (http://nodejs.org/).

Install the dependencies with `npm install`, then run `node find-company-officers`.
